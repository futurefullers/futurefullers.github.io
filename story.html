              <p>At a small Mexican joint in Chicago called Mayan Palace where a few mutual friends were meeting for a margarita at the "driving range" before beginning an adventurous night of pub golf. This was the beginning of a beautiful relationship.</p>

Despite Kelly's non-existent spice tolerance and Pat's planning abilities (the place closed as they were ordering food), it was the start of something wonderful.</p>
