        #### Myopic Books
        If you like books, check this place out. It's famous for its sheer density
        of used books. It's also a fire waiting to happen, so stop by before
        it's too late!

        #### Chicago Q
        A solid BBQ choice for sit-down upscale, but you may also
        want to look into Lilly Q or Smokehouse if you have a smaller, more
        flexible group.

        your chicago dogs and italian beef, and then plan to follow it up with a nap.

        Blues until 4 AM! There's a $10 cover, but it's worth it. Makes for a
        great Saturday night outing.

        #### Architecture Boat Tour
        It somehow took Pat and Kelly six years before they went on this boat
        cruise, but it's since become a go-to spot to take new visitors. If
        weather permits, you should check it out!

        One of the best burgers in the city. Five-hour waits are not unheard
        of, so put your name in early then go grab some drinks at Haymarket.

        An iconic stadium right in the middle of a Chicago neighborhood. Even if
        nothing's going on at the field, there's always lots of activity at the
        surrounding bars.

        #### Crisp
        This is where Pat took Kelly on their first date! Well, where he tried
        to take her - turns out they close at 9. It's Korean fried chicken,
        and it's delicious. Way better than non-Korean fried chicken.
