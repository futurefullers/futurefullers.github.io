        At a small Mexican joint in Chicago called Mayan Palace where a few mutual
        friends were meeting for a margarita at the "driving range" before beginning
        an adventurous night of pub golf. This was the beginning of a beautiful
        relationship.

        After realizing there might be more to this than friendship, Pat worked
        up the nerve to ask Kelly on a date to his favorite spot - Crisp -
        a small Korean BBQ wings place. Despite Kelly's non-existent spice
        tolerance and Pat's planning abilities (the place closed as they
        were ordering food), it was the start of something wonderful.

        They get engaged!

        **His Story:** The planning of the proposal started *many* months before the day.
        The main requirement for me was that it take place in London (Kelly's absolute
        favorite place). The plan was to softly suggest the trip idea to Kelly, then
        let her love of planning take over. It worked perfectly. Her parents were
        very eager to help, and, over the next  months, we all struggled to keep
        her oblivious to the plans. There were too many near misses to count, but
        we all somehow made it to London without the surprise ruined. By the time
        I asked the question, I was as relieved as I was excited.

        **Her Story:** I love London and I couldn't wait to show Pat the
        city. My parents needed to be in town for work, so we combined trips! As
        all of us were walking back from dinner the night before, my dad asks us
        "Want to have wine and cheese in the park tomorrow?" I immediately respond
        with a quick yes, because that combination sounds fantastic. Fast forward
        to the next day, Pat and I are running late (as usual) to meet them in the
        park, so I'm feeling bad and speed walking to the meeting point. We get to
        the meeting bench and they aren't there yet. Yay! We aren't the late ones!
        Unbeknownst to me, my parents have been hiding in some bushes for the last
        half hour, waiting to take pictures. We sit down. Pat's out of breath due
        to the jogging, so I get the wine started. After the glasses are poured,
        Pat puts his arm around me and says "It's time...", it's a blur, and the
        rest is history!

chicago: |
    *We will be filling this in over time so check back soon!*

    Pat and Kelly love to explore, eat, and drink around Chicago. We would love
    for you to try some of our favorite spots, so you can fall in love with
    Chicago too. Everything is accessible by public transportation
    (L or bus - $2.25 a ride), as well as cab.

    To the right, you will find:

     1. Recommended bars to spend time between the Ceremony and the Reception
     2. Recommended restaurants to eat at on non-wedding nights (to be added)
     3. Recommended bars to celebrate at on any night (to be added)
     4. Recommended Chicago attractions if you have extra time (to be added)

hotels: |
    For the convenience and comfort of our guests, we have reserved
    blocks of hotel rooms at three different locations and we wanted
    to pass on relevant information.

    Three things to note are:

     1. There are going to be large conventions in Chicago the same week as our wedding so hotel rooms will sell fast
     2. If you plan to check in on Friday, you may want to request early check-in due to the early start time
     3. There will be shuttles available to take guests from hotels to the ceremony and back!

    If you do intend on coming (and weâ€™re hoping you do),
    please reserve before September 15th.

travel:
    planes: |
        We are close to both Chicago airports (17 miles from O'Hare and 11 miles
        from Midway). Each airport is easily accessible by subway or taxi, so they're
        both good choices. From the airport, we highly recommend the "L" for
        cost and ease of use.

        If you decide to take a cab, be sure to incorporate traffic into your
        travel time. You can also take Uber or Lyft to save some money.

        #### O'Hare

        ###### Chicago's main airport with most airlines

        Follow the signs through O'Hare to the <span class="ohare">CTA Blue Line</span> train.
        Take CTA downtown to <span class="ohare">Monroe</span> stop (for University Club/Palmer House)
        or <span class="ohare">Washington</span> (for Residence Inn).

        #### Midway

        ###### Chicago's other airport (Pat prefers it)

        Follow the signs through Midway to the <span class="midway">CTA Orange Line</span> train.
        Take CTA downtown to <span class="midway">Adams/Wabash</span> (for University Club/Palmer House)
        or <span class="midway">Washington/Wells</span> (for Residence Inn).
    trains: |
        To avoid driving and parking, There are plenty of train options to get to
        Chicago from the Chicagoland suburbs or Michigan via Metra or Amtrak.
        The stations highlighted are all within walking distance (or short cab)
        from the recommended hotels.
    automobiles: |
        If you decide to drive into the city (although we don't recommend it!),
        each hotel offers valet parking ($42-75 per night) and there are numerous
        self-parking garages (~$45 daily).

        We listed a few of the nearby ones, but there are plenty of others. If
        you're looking to save some money, check out [SpotHero](http://www.spothero.com)
        to find extra availability.
