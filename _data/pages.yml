      header: They Meet
      content: |
        At a small Mexican joint in Chicago called Mayan Palace where a few mutual
        friends were meeting for a margarita at the "driving range" before beginning
        an adventurous night of pub golf. This was the beginning of a beautiful
        relationship.

        After realizing there might be more to this than friendship, Pat worked
        up the nerve to ask Kelly on a date to his favorite spot - Crisp -
        a small Korean BBQ wings place. Despite Kelly's non-existent spice
        tolerance and Pat's planning abilities (the place closed as they
        were ordering food), it was the start of something wonderful.

    recommend either relaxing back at your hotel room or posting up at a bar in
    the area. Please refer to the [Chicago Guide](/chicago) for some bar recommendations.

    *We will be filling this in over time so check back soon!*

    Pat and Kelly love to explore, eat, and drink around Chicago. We would love
    for you to try some of our favorite spots, so you can fall in love with
    Chicago too. Everything is accessible by public transportation
    (L or bus - $2.25 a ride), as well as cab.

    To the right, you will find:

     1. Recommended bars to spend time between the Ceremony and the Reception
     2. Recommended restaurants to eat at on non-wedding nights (to be added)
     3. Recommended bars to celebrate at on any night (to be added)
     4. Recommended Chicago attractions if you have extra time (to be added)

accommodations: |
    For the convenience and comfort of our guests, we have reserved
    blocks of hotel rooms at three different locations and we wanted
    to pass on relevant information.

    Three things to note are:

     1. There are going to be large conventions in Chicago the same week as our wedding so hotel rooms will sell fast
     2. If you plan to check in on Friday, you may want to request early check-in due to the early start time
     3. There will be shuttles available to take guests from hotels to the ceremony and back!

    If you do intend on coming (and weâ€™re hoping you do),
    please reserve before September 15th.

travel:
    planes: |
        We are close to both Chicago airports (17 miles from O'Hare and 11 miles
        from Midway). Each airport is easily accessible by subway or taxi, so they're
        both good choices. From the airport, we highly recommend the "L" for
        cost and ease of use.

        If you decide to take a cab, be sure to incorporate traffic into your
        travel time. You can also take Uber or Lyft to save some money.

        #### O'Hare

        ###### Chicago's main airport with most airlines

        Follow the signs through O'Hare to the <span class="ohare">CTA Blue Line</span> train.
        Take CTA downtown to <span class="ohare">Monroe</span> stop (for University Club/Palmer House)
        or <span class="ohare">Washington</span> (for Residence Inn).
        Short walk to all recommended hotels (~0.25 miles).

        #### Midway

        ###### Chicago's other airport (Pat prefers it)

        Follow the signs through Midway to the <span class="midway">CTA Orange Line</span> train.
        Take CTA downtown to <span class="midway">Adams/Wabash</span> (for University Club/Palmer House)
        or <span class="midway">Washington/Wells</span> (for Residence Inn). Walk 0.1 miles to all hotels.
    trains: |
        To avoid driving and parking, There are plenty of train options to get to
        Chicago from the Chicagoland suburbs or Michigan via Metra or Amtrak.
        The stations highlighted are all within walking distance (or short cab)
        from the recommended hotels.
    automobiles: |
        If you decide to drive into the city (although we don't recommend it!),
        each hotel offers valet parking ($42-75 per night) and there are numerous
        self-parking garages (~$45 daily).

        We listed a few of the nearby ones, but there are plenty of others. If
        you're looking to save some money, check out [SpotHero](http://www.spothero.com)
        to find extra availability.
