        At a small Mexican joint in Chicago called Mayan Palace where a few mutual
        friends were meeting for a margarita at the "driving range" before beginning
        an adventurous night of pub golf. This was the beginning of a beautiful
        relationship.

        After realizing there might be more to this than friendship, Pat worked
        up the nerve to ask Kelly on a date to his favorite spot - Crisp -
        a small Korean BBQ wings place. Despite Kelly's non-existent spice
        tolerance and Pat's planning abilities (the place closed as they
        were ordering food), it was the start of something wonderful.

    Guide!
accommodations: |
    For the convenience and comfort of our guests, we have reserved
    blocks of hotel rooms at three different locations and we wanted
    to pass on relevant information - listed below in order of
    distance closest to the reception.

    Three things to note are:

     1. There are going to be large conventions in Chicago the same week as our wedding so hotel rooms will sell fast
     2. If you plan to check in on Friday, you may want to request early check-in due to the early start time
     3. There will be shuttles available to take guests from hotels to the ceremony and back!

    If you do intend on coming (and weâ€™re hoping you do),
    please reserve before September 15th.
