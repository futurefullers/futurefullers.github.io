            <p>
                For the convenience and comfort of our guests, we have reserved
                blocks of hotel rooms at three different locations and we wanted
                to pass on relevant information - listed below in order of
                distance closest to the reception.
            </p>
            <p>
                Three things to note are 1) that there are going to be large
                conventions in Chicago the same week as our wedding so hotel
                rooms will sell fast, 2) if you plan to check-in on Friday,
                you may want to request early check-in due to the early start
                time, and 3) there will be shuttles available to take guests
                from hotels to the ceremony and back!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do intend on coming (and weâ€™re hoping you do),
                please reserve before September 15th.
            </p>
